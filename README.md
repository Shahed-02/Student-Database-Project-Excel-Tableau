# 🌐 Student Database Project: Excel , Tableau & Power BI

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project explores student data to uncover insights about academic performance, demographics, and trends. Leveraging **Excel** for data cleaning and preparation and **Tableau** for data visualization, I created an interactive dashboard to present key findings in a user-friendly format. 📊✨

The dashboard highlights:
- **Academic performance analysis** across multiple metrics.
- **Demographic breakdown** of students.
- **Interactive visualizations** to explore trends and relationships in the data.

## 😅 Reflections
This project enhanced my ability to work with real-world data and create engaging visual narratives. Using **Excel** for meticulous preparation  **Tableau**  & **Power BI** for dynamic storytelling, I developed a dashboard that simplifies complex datasets into actionable insights. 🚀
It made me understand Pivot Tables more. That using filters wont exclude incomplete data in a Pivot Table!
