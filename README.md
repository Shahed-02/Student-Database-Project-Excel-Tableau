# 🌐 Student Database Project: Excel, Tableau & Power BI

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project explores student data to uncover insights about academic performance, demographics, and trends. Leveraging **Excel** for data cleaning and preparation, **Tableau** and **Power BI** for data visualization, I created interactive dashboards to present key findings in user-friendly formats. 📊✨

The dashboards highlight:
- **Academic performance analysis** 🎓 across multiple metrics.
- **Demographic breakdown** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 of students.
- **Interactive visualizations** 📈 to explore trends and relationships in the data.

## 🛠️ Tools and Skills  

### 📋 Excel: Data Cleaning and Analysis  
- **Dataset Cleaning** 🧹: Identified and removed duplicate entries, handled missing values, and corrected inconsistent data (e.g., fixing incorrect gender values and converting lowercase names to proper formatting).
- **Calculations** 📊: Used Excel functions such as **SUM** to calculate the total credits earned by all students and **AVERAGE** to determine the average GPA across the dataset.
- **Pivot Tables** 🏢: Created a pivot table to provide a clear summary of average GPA by department, making it easier to spot trends.

### 🔵 Tableau: Data Visualization  
- Designed a **dashboard** 📊 to showcase student enrollment trends and GPA distribution by department. The visuals allow users to easily explore patterns and differences across academic performance.

### 🟡 Power BI: Advanced Visualization and Reporting  
- Developed an interactive report 📏 to visualize GPA distribution. Integrated slicers and filters for advanced interactivity, allowing users to focus on specific data subsets and uncover hidden insights.

## 😅 Reflections
This project enhanced my ability to work with real-world data and create engaging visual narratives. Using **Excel** for meticulous preparation and **Tableau** and **Power BI** for dynamic storytelling, I developed dashboards that simplify complex datasets into actionable insights.
Pivot tables use the whole dataset not just the filtered out versions so its important for next time! 🚀
